## Code and materials to reproduce graphics in "A generalized additive model
approach to time-to-event analysis"

To reproduce the paper

  - run the `graphics-tutorial.R` script with the working directory set to the `Paper` folder

  - Build the `pamtutorial.tex` LaTeX file.


### Notes

- To reproduce the results you will need to install the `pammtools` package.
(At the moment of this writing we used release version v0.0.3.1: https://github.com/adibender/pammtools/releases/tag/v0.0.3.1)

- The code to install v0.0.3.1 version of the `pammtools`  package is already
contained in the `graphics-tutorial.R` script

- In the link above, you will also find zipped files of the package source code
as well as installable binaries for linux/mac and windows

- For completeness the installable packages for linux/mac and windows are also
contained in this folder
