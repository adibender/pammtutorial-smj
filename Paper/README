## Instruction to reproduce analyses

To reproduce the analyses presented in the paper, the following steps need to 
be performed

- Install the `packrat` package

```
install.packages("packrat")
```

- Run the code in the `graphics-tutorial.R` file. 

Note that 
- at the beginning `packrat` will try to install the packages with 
the same version as used by the authors for the analysis, thus a stable 
internet connection is required. 
- the installed packages will be installed to a special library, thus you 
need not worry, that packages in your global library will be overwritten
- when running the `packrat::restore()` command for the first time, 
installation of all packages and their dependencies can take some time. 


To view the vignettes in the `pam` package as described in the paper, 
you may need to additionaly run: 

```
devtools::install_github("adibener/pam", build_vignettes=TRUE)
```
